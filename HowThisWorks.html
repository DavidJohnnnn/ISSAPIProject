Make an app that returns the country, that the ISS is currently flying over.

Needed:
ISS API: http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/
MapQuest API (reverse geocoding)
NASA Earth API

It should have the image of the view from a NASA satellite above the point where the ISS is. When you keep refreshing a new point will be added to the map allowing the user to see the latest point the ISS is located and the slight shape of the path it is following (but no poly line).
